# Developement state (old)
Still lacking basic features, like **swiping**, **search feature**, *~~likes~~ and comments*, **actually secure servers** and *better UI/UX*

*Italic* means *Not important*\
**Bold** means **Very important, should be added NOW!!!**\
~~StrikeThrough~~ means ~~Added~~

> [!WARNING]  
> The like feature is still experimental and might lead to duplicate likes in future releases.

# Open-source

Is the app gonna be open-source?

Yes! Totally. My goal with Swipin is to make a base for people that want to make a TikTok-like app just like me!
Some things wont be open-source, like API keys, servers URLs, and things like that.

# With what do I make my apps? (Docs/Hardware/Program)

For documentation/help, I use StackOverflow and Android Developers, it helps me a lot for many things.

Now I'm making the app in Sketchware Pro, using a Redmi Note 8T to code the app, and a Oppo A74 to test if the app works on different devices.

# Will it be on the Play Store?

Not, yet. If I want the app to be on the Play Store, I'm gonna have to make it really polished, and I can't do that myself. But, I'm gonna try to put in on F-Droid!

# Where can I download the .swb file for use in SketchWare?

With the pre-release downloads, not the normal release, now, why only with the pre-release?
Beacause, with the pre-releases, there is gonna be no servers, only local videos and a customizable JSON file for editing likes, comments, etc.

# Help! The app keeps crashing or saying I don't have internet!

If the app crashes, go open an Issue.
If there a connectivity issue, first, check if it's a pre-release version, I might forget to remove the Internet check in them. But if it's a release version, check your Internet, and maybe the servers are down. If after one day it's still not fixed, open an Issue.
