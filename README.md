# Developement state (old)
Still lacking basic features, like **swiping**, **search feature**, *~~likes~~ and comments*, **actually secure servers** and *better UI/UX*

*Italic* means *Not important*\
**Bold** means **Very important, should be added NOW!!!**\
~~StrikeThrough~~ means ~~Added~~

> [!WARNING]  
> The like feature is still experimental and might lead to duplicate likes in future releases.


# Help! The app keeps crashing or saying I don't have internet!

If the app crashes, go open an Issue.
If there a connectivity issue, first, check if it's a pre-release version, I might forget to remove the Internet check in them. But if it's a release version, check your Internet, and maybe the servers are down. If after one day it's still not fixed, open an Issue.
