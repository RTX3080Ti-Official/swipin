# Questions and answers

##  What's the future of Swipin?
Honestly, as of right now, I don't really know, obviously, Swipin is gonna be discountinued one day or another but when? I have no idea.

## From what version should I clone the Swipin repository?
Either, the latest pre-release version, or the 1.0 Release/Beta 1.9 Prerelease 4.

## Is the app gonna be open-source?

Yes! Totally. My goal with Swipin is to make a base for people that want to make a TikTok-like app just like me!
Some things wont be open-source, like API keys, servers URLs, and things like that.

## With what do I make my apps? (Docs/Hardware/Program)

For documentation/help, I use StackOverflow and Android Developers, it helps me a lot for many things.

Now I'm making the app in Sketchware Pro, using a Redmi Note 8T to code the app, and a Oppo A74 to test if the app works on different devices.

## Will it be on the Play Store?

Not, yet. If I want the app to be on the Play Store, I'm gonna have to make it really polished, and I can't do that myself. But, I'm gonna try to put in on F-Droid!

## Where can I download the .swb file for use in SketchWare?

With the pre-release downloads, not the normal release, now, why only with the pre-release?
Beacause, with the pre-releases, there is gonna be no servers, only local videos and a customizable JSON file for editing likes, comments, etc.
